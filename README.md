I'm currently a student who loves to delve into all things software, and using it to come up with unique and innovative solutions! I have previous experience with Software Development, QA automation, Full-stack development, Business Intelligence and Machine Learning! In my free time I enjoy going on walks, reading, training Muay Thai, and watching the Chicago Bulls lose ... 😥.
🎮 I'm currently working on creating an open-world adventure game using Unity!
